The code in newsreport.py deals with linking to a PostgreSQL database that contains news articles and 
generating a few reports on the command line, such as most popular articles and most popular authors. 

To run the code, you first need to have access to the database, which is stored in a vagrant directory to be
run through a Virtualbox. The vagrant directory can be found here: https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm

Install Virtualbox and follow the README on the linked Github page if you're interested in actually running the code.
Afterwards, you can run my program on the command line, within the vagrant directory, by typing python3 newsreport.py
